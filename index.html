<h2> Here Is A Little About Myself.</h2>
		<p> Hello, my name is Alejandra Aguirre and I am a sixteen year old who loves superheroes. My love for superheroes is so big that my Quincea√±era was superhero themed. Although Marvel has a vast selection of heroe movies, I chose my top six favorite movies and decided to share them with you!!!</p> <br><br><br>
<h1> <center> #6 Black Panther </center> </h1>

		<p> Black Panther is a movie based on the king T'Challa from Wakanda.This movie has a lot of funny scenes and shows a culture that had not been displayed before in a Marvel movie. What I enjoy the most of this movie is the family bond that is potrayed throughout the entire movie. My favorite character is T'Challa's sister, Shuri. Shuri is the member of the team that creates the technology for Black Panther. The reason she is my favorite character is that she is really smart and sarcastic. </p>
<h1> <center> #5 Spider-Man: Far From Home </center> <h1>

<h3> Spider-Man:Far From Home is the seond movie of Spider-Man starring Tom Holland. The reason I enjoy watching this movie is because as a teenager I can kind of relate to their problems. Peter Parker has to decide wether he is going to do what he wants to do or do the right thing and I feel that that is a common decision many teenagers have to face. Peter Parker also gets betrayed by the person that he trusted and felt connected to which is also something many teenagers go through. The best part of the movie was being able to see how Peter Parker was able to fix his mistakes and learn from them. </h3>
<h1> <center> #4 Guardians Of The Galaxy </center> </h1>
	<img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b5/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_poster.jpg height="400" width"350">
<h3> This movie is just funny. Before the movie came out, I hadn't even heard of the Guardians Of The Galaxy, however once I saw the characteras and the story line, I loved it. I realy enjoy how the characters are all sarcastic and how each of them have an individual mission they want to accomplish. What I most enjoyed from this movie was seeing how the characters slowly started to become a family. Each charater has their own flaws but they really complememt each other as a group. My favorite scene from this movie was the dance battle at the end of the movie. It was hilarious to see how a dance battle saved the universe.</h3>
