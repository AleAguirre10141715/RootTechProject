<h3> The reason I enjoy watching this movie is because of the fight scenes. This movie has one of the best fight scenes which is when the avengers are fighting against each other. Another cool thing in this movie, is the introduction to the new Spider- Man. This was the first movie I hads ever seen where the bad guys were actually the heroes. I remeber the big debate in my school where everyone had to choose a side and discussions people would have based on this movie. I chose Captain America's side. </h3>

	<h3> This movie is the first to ever make me cry in a theater I remember waiting in a long line just to get seats and leaving the the theater teary eyed while my sister was bawling her eyes next to me. I probably saw this movie like 5 times in just one month. The best scene was by far the fight in Wakanda, however, the saddest scene in history was Spider-Man's death.</h3>

<h3> I waited a whole year to see this movie. I bought the tickets the day they were out to sell and watched the movie at 1 in the morning and still went to school the next day. This movie was a rollercoaster for me. I felt happy, sad, confused, and devestated just in three hours. This was the second movie that ever made me cry in the theater. I remember walking out and seeing everyone else teary eyed at least. For sure there wasn't a dry eye at the end of the movie. Also the expierience of seeing this movie really late made it even better. I ron Man's death and Captain America's retirement were the biggest plot twists that made this movie awesome.</h3> <br><br>
